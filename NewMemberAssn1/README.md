# New Member Assignment 1  

The goals of this assignment are to:  
- Learn how to pull and push using Git  
- Understand the GRC firmware architecture for this year  
- Experiment with different functions on the ESP32  

Each member should **clone this repository** to their local machine, then create a branch named **`name-Asn1`**. All work must be done on your own branch.  

## Tasks  

Complete the two predefined functions:  

### `LedFlash`  
- This function takes the GPIO pin of the onboard LED (pin 2).  
- It is responsible for toggling this pin on and off at a fast rate, causing the LED to flash.  

### `PwmGeneration`  
- The function inputs are flexible. Two example inputs are provided, but the function can be implemented in many different ways.  
- A GPIO pin should be passed in, and this pin must generate the PWM signal.  
- Members must verify that the signal is being generated by displaying it on the oscilloscope in the shop.  

## Notes  

- If you encounter an error while flashing code to the microcontroller, **hold the BOOT button** while flashing to successfully load the code onto the MCU.
